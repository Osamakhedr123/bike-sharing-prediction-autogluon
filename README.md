# Bike Sharing Demand Prediction with Autogluon 
The purpose of the project is to predict the bike sharing demand, that is: given a specific date with specific features, we want the model to predict the number of bikes that will be in demand,I used Autogluon to create a base model without any adjustments, it didn't do well, so I tried extracting more features without any hyperparameter optimization, it did significantly better. finally I tried hyperparameter optimization and the decrease in error was also significant, but I think the best way to improve the performance is working on the data by adding more records and feature engineering.
